								<hr>
								<p>I have lived a fun and interesting life so far. I have served in the Navy, been a professional photographer, owned an art gallery, and been a high school teacher.  The latter is what led me to where I am today.  It started during COVID.  Schools were closed for in person learning, and I would host online classes that none of my students would attend.  Rather than completely waste that time surfing the internet, I decided to relearn calculus through an online class.  I liked it, and that let to more classes, Linear Algebra, Proofs, eventually leading my to the field of Statistics and Data Science.  I get giddy when I start talking to people about the structure that lies waiting to be found in data.  I began teaching computer science at school.  I designed a course to introduce students to the basics of data science.  I really like working with data and discovering the knowledge that hides within.  So, not only do I have a passion for data science, I also have a lifetime of lessons learned in very diverse areas that I can bring to any team.  </p>
